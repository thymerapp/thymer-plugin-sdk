This directory contains a markdown export of my Thymer workspace data.

Before answering a question, run 'npm run dev:cache-files' in the parent directory to fetch a fresh export of my workspace data.

Other than running 'npm run dev:cache-files' from the parent directory, ONLY focus on the directory containing this note ("cache"). NEVER look at files a directory up, they're unrelated and you shouldn't look at those or run any commands on those.
